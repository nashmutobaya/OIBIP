Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data
In this project, you will work with a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help the retail business make informed decisions.

Task 2: Customer Segmentation AnalysisProject Description:The aim of this data analytics project is to perform customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, the goal is togroup customers into distinct segments. This segmentation can inform targeted marketingstrategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies.

Task 3:
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate a numerical outcome based on a dataset with relevant features. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorith, and this project offers hands-on experience in developing, evaluating and interpreting a preedictive model.

Task 4: 
The focus is on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, offering a real-world application of machine learning in the context of viticulture. The dataset encompasses diverse chemical attributes, including density and acidity, which serve as the features for three distinct classifier models.
